# Rain-Prediction-in-Australia
For The project,  utilized rainfall dataset from the Australian Government's Bureau of Meteorology, clean the data, and apply different classification algorithms to the data.

## Algorithms used to build models:

1.  Linear Regression
2.  KNN
3.  Decision Trees
4.  Logistic Regression
5.  SVM


## The results are reported as the accuracy of each classifier, using the following metrics when these are applicable:

1. Accuracy Score
2. Jaccard Index
3. F1-Score
4. LogLoss
5. Mean Absolute Error
6. Mean Squared Error
7. R2-Score
